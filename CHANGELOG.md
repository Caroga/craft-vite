# Vite Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.0.6 - UNRELEASED
### Changed
* Change the default `useDevServer` setting to `App::env('ENVIRONMENT') === 'dev'` (https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite/issues/6)

## 1.0.5 - 2021.05.14
### Added
* Moved the live reload through Twig errors to the ViteService so that plugins can get it too
* Added `.inline()` to allow for inlining of local or remote files in your templates, with a caching layer

### Changed
* Use `registerJsFile()` instead of `registerScript()`
* Make the cache last for 30 seconds with `devMode` on
* Refactored to `ViteVariableInterface` & `ViteVariableTrait`

## 1.0.4 - 2021.05.08
### Added
* Added the `devServerInternal` setting back in, along with `checkDevServer` for people who want the fallback behavior (https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite/issues/2)

### Changed
* Use `PRIMARY_SITE_URL` in the default config instead of `SITE_URL`
* Switch over to VitePress for the docs

## 1.0.3 - 2021.05.07

## 1.0.2 - 2021-05-06
### Changed
